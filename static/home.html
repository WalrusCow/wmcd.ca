  <h2>Yes. That is my name. This is my website.</h2>
  <p>Hello. You can see here a small showcase of my work (or the work that
  can run on a website) as well as more detail about who I am. Hopefully it
  is almost as entertaining to read as it was to write.</p>
  <p>PS: While you're up here, check out that cool animation (you can even see
  <a href="https://github.com/WalrusCow/graph">how I did it</a>).</p>

  <p>Shockingly enough, I exist beyond the Internet, and like things other
  than software. Some of these "things" are hiking, travelling, food
  and hockey.</p>
  <p>Fun facts: I can type pretty quickly (about 100 words per minute), I can
  cook a mean tikka masala, I enjoy learning math and I love reading.</p>
  <p>I also have the excellent fortune to be dating
  <a href="http://www.ostrowski.ca">a wonderful woman</a> (who also has a very
  nice website).</p>

  <p>Yeah, I also write code. You can even see some of it
  <a href="https://github.com/WalrusCow">on GitHub</a>.</p>
  <p>
  Actually, I happen to really like code. Like, a lot. Not just cod<em>ing</em>
  but code in general. Good code makes me happy, while bad code makes me
  sad.
  </p>
  <p>
  I am a firm believer in the benefits of both free and open source software,
  and I try to contribute back where I can. I always use the open source
  version where possible, and love to read the code. Of course, no paragraph
  like this could be complete without mentioning my OS of choice - Ubuntu.
  </p>
  <p>
  I'm currently enrolled in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo.
  Yep, it's in Canada. Pretty cool, eh? While at school, I've had the good
  fortune to do several internships, most recently at <a
    href="https://www.vessel.com">Vessel</a>. There, I was focused on creating
  their first Android application.
  </p>
  <p>
  I also interned at Facebook (link probably not necessary), where I did
  infrastructure work in C++, <a
    href="http://www.bazaarvoice.com">Bazaarvoice</a>, where I did a bunch of
  work in node.js and <a href="http://www.windriver.com/">Wind River</a>, where
  I worked on some internal systems in Python (3!).
  </p>
  <p>
  I love learning new things, and I'm easily excited by all things tech.  Have
  a cool new technology you're excited about? Just want to chat? Looking for a
  laundry list of technologies I've worked with?

  <p>Once upon a time, I wrote three basic games using the HTML5 canvas in
  order to teach myself JavaScript. You can play them here - I hope you like
  them. You can also find the source to each
  <a href="https://github.com/WalrusCow">on GitHub</a>.</p>

  <nav id="control-container" class="tab-control-list">
    <a class="tab-control">Tetvas</a>
    <a class="tab-control">Snake</a>
    <a class="tab-control">Life</a>
    <div class="tab-control-highlight"></div>
  </nav>

  <div id="tab-container" class="tab-container">
    <div class="tab tab-center">
      <h3>Tetvas</h3>
      <p>It's just a Tetris clone. I created it with my favourite
      keybindings - sorry if they don't match your expectations!</p>
      <p>Use ↑ and Z to rotate, shift to hold and ctrl to drop. Press P to
      pause the game.</p>

      <p>Check out the source
        <a href="https://github.com/WalrusCow/tetvas">on GitHub</a>.</p>

      <h3>Snake</h3>
      <p>Most people have played snake before in some form or other.  If
      you don't know how to play, it's very simple.  Using the arrow keys
      (or WSAD) to control the "snake" (orange thing), collect the food (blue
      things) to grow longer.</p>
      <p>You lose if the snake hits itself or any wall!</p>
      <p>You can find <a href="https://github.com/WalrusCow/snake">the
        source</a> on GitHub.</p>

      <h3>Conway's Game of Life</h3>
      <p>If you haven't heard of Conway's Game of Life before, you should read
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">the Wikipedia
        article</a>, which does a good job at describing what it is.
      </p>
      <p>Alternatively, you can just start clicking on the canvas below.
        Press play once you have some squares and see what happens!
      </p>
      <p>And a <a href="https://github.com/WalrusCow/game-of-life">link to the source</a>
      for the curious.
